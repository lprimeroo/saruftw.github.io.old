I recently concluded my first international vacation with a few colleagues. We wandered off to Malaysia for 8 days solely because the flight tickets were much cheaper than traveling to a place locally. Boarding a total of 5 flights costed each of us Rs. 19000 (or ~$280 at the time). We relied on Skyscanner, AirBnB, Uber/Grab and HitList (highly recommended!) for travel and lodging for most part of our trip.

In retrospect, the vacation turned out to be an epitome of liberation for me. I witnessed exotic sights, had scrumptious delicacies, stayed in lavish residences(thanks to AirBnB!), met some fantastic people and finally understood the definition of _CHILLING_.

Here's a picture of me swimming on the 51st floor of our accommodation overlooking the Petronas Towers and the KL Tower(not in the picture).

### Kota Kinabalu

The journey began by flying to Kota Kinabalu from Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur. Kota Kinabalu is a small city located in the Eastern part of Malaysia called Sabah. The day we landed here, it was pouring so heavily that you could literally observe the overpowering silence created by the massive smashing of rain to the ground. The city came across to me as sort of a _retirement paradise_. Pleasant weather, modern architecture, good restaurants/bars and picturesque islands at a stones throw distance. Overall, it had a very laidback feel attached to it. I'd definitely settle here if I plan on taking a pause from life. Philosophical notions aside, Kota Kinabalu has umpteen number of speed boat services that ply from the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/W6BcrpiMJL22">Jesselton Jetty Point</a> to a number of islands such as Manukan, Gaya, Sulug, Mamutik, and many more. You could either charter a boat and hop around all of them or hitch a service to any one of them. We zeroed-in on Manukan and tried out some snorkeling for the very first time. These pictures should give an idea of how serene the nature looks when the sand is white and sky is filled with clouds.

As we were relaxing on the island, we started to get bewildered by the changing climate which eventually turned itself into a storm in a short span of time. The entire population present on the island started to rush towards the shacks to protect themselves from the sand, rain and falling trees. Vacant boats started to evacuate family crowd first. We were one of the last factions to leave the island. Call it fate, but the storm subsided as soon as we left the island. The video below(recorded by my colleague) shows the initial behavior of the storm. The storm became more violent after this and then eventually subsided.

I really wanted to trek Mount Kinabalu and give scuba diving a shot. Since we were short on time, we decided to explore the city instead. Personally, I'm not an ardent supporter of going to bars or visiting shopping areas or traveling within the city in general. But to maintain the fun quotient of your travel group, it's important to please everyone's interests. We hung mostly around the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AvGNZ6CxPRK2">Suria Sabah Complex</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/YNzLCgnQAAw">Waterfront</a>. Waterfront is a really beautiful place in the daylight and a place bustling with bars, pubs and discotheques when the sun settles. Decent place for moderately priced drinks and food.

The next day, I bid adieu to the most mellow city I've been to and boarded a flight for our next destination, Penang.

<br/>

### Penang

Penang is an old city with a load of historical backing. Penang isn't as exciting as other places and is more of a family destination. Definitely, not meant for explorers or people who're on a relaxed vacation. Won't ramble much about Penang, since there wasn't anything awe-striking to witness here. Regardless of that, we had a lot of fun renting out <a href="https://www.linkbike.my/">bikes</a> and exploring <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/B5x4SCHCH6S2">George Town</a>. Apart from that, we also visited the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RZwkoPc5HPM2">Penang Hill</a> and the infamous <a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=love+lane+georgetown&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEuaLn2pjYAhXLpo8KHTXvATAQ_AUICygC&biw=1280&bih=703">Love Lane</a> (at night!). The most exhilarating part of my stay here was my AirBnB accommodation. Simply magnificent. Have a look at the pictures and feel free to judge.
