I recently concluded my first international vacation with a few colleagues. We wandered off to Malaysia for 8 days solely because the flight tickets were much cheaper than traveling to a place locally. Boarding a total of 5 flights costed each of us Rs. 19000 (or ~$280 at the time). We relied on Skyscanner, AirBnB, Uber/Grab and HitList (highly recommended!) for travel and lodging for most part of our trip.

In retrospect, the vacation turned out to be an epitome of liberation for me. I witnessed exotic sights, had scrumptious delicacies, stayed in lavish residences(thanks to AirBnB!), met some fantastic people and finally understood the definition of _CHILLING_.

Here's a picture of me swimming on the 51st floor of our accommodation overlooking the Petronas Towers and the KL Tower(not in the picture).

### Kota Kinabalu

The journey began by flying to Kota Kinabalu from Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur. Kota Kinabalu is a small city located in the Eastern part of Malaysia called Sabah. The day we landed here, it was pouring so heavily that you could literally observe the overpowering silence created by the massive smashing of rain to the ground. The city came across to me as sort of a _retirement paradise_. Pleasant weather, modern architecture, good restaurants/bars and picturesque islands at a stones throw distance. Overall, it had a very laidback feel attached to it. I'd definitely settle here if I plan on taking a pause from life. Philosophical notions aside, Kota Kinabalu has umpteen number of speed boat services that ply from the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/W6BcrpiMJL22">Jesselton Jetty Point</a> to a number of islands such as Manukan, Gaya, Sulug, Mamutik, and many more. You could either charter a boat and hop around all of them or hitch a service to any one of them. We zeroed in on visiting the Manukan Island and tried out some snorkeling for the first time ever. These pictures should give an idea of how serene nature looks when the sand is white and sky is pale blue.
