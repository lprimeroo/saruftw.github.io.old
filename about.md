I am **Sarthak Munshi**. Currently, I work at <u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a></u> where I develop full stack applications. I studied Computer Science at the <u><a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/">University of Pune</a></u> and graduated in 2017. 

In the past, I have had the opportunity to intern at <u><a href="http://thirddime.com/">Thirddime</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a></u>. I also worked as a Research Intern under <u><a href="https://www.christosmakridis.com/">Christos Makridis</a></u> at <u><a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford Univeristy</a></u> where the research was focused on the areas of public and labor economics.

I also successfully qualified for the <u><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a></u> program under the <u><a href="http://chapel.cray.com/">Chapel</a></u> organization. My work here dealt with arming the Chapel runtime ecosystem with its own set of cryptography modules.

I also maintain <u><a href="http://preppapers.com/">PrepPapers</a></u>, a nifty little website that aggregates question papers of multiple competitive examinations across India.

My primary interest these days is in full stack web development, machine learning and cryptography. My projects draw ideas from a multitude of domains available in Computer Science.



Cheers!
