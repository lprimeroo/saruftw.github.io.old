I am **Sarthak Munshi**. <!-- Currently, I work at <u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a></u> where I develop full stack applications.--> I studied Computer Science at the <u><a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/">University of Pune</a></u> and graduated in 2017. 

In the past, I have had the opportunity to intern at <u><a href="http://thirddime.com/">Thirddime</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a></u>. I also worked as a Research Intern under <u><a href="https://www.christosmakridis.com/">Christos Makridis</a></u> at <u><a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford Univeristy</a></u> where the research was focused on the areas of public and labor economics.

I also successfully qualified for the <u><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a></u> program under the <u><a href="http://chapel.cray.com/">Chapel</a></u> organization. My work here dealt with arming the Chapel runtime ecosystem with its own set of cryptography modules.

I also maintain <u><a href="http://preppapers.com/">PrepPapers</a></u>, a nifty website that aggregates question papers of multiple competitive examinations across India.

I make it a point to open source the stuff that I create. Most of it is accessible on my GitHub profile.

My primary interest these days is in full stack web development, machine learning and cryptography. My projects draw ideas from a multitude of domains available in Computer Science.

Being an avid art aficionado, I also tend to watch a lot of movies and try to squeeze in time for reading books. [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur55860534/">IMDB</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52421092-sarthak-munshi">Goodreads</a>].

Cheers!
