I am **Sarthak Munshi**. Currently, I work at <u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a></u> where I develop full stack applications. I studied Computer Science at the University of Pune. 
In the past, I have had the opportunity to intern at <u><a href="http://thirddime.com/">Thirddime</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a></u>. I also worked as a Research Intern under <u><a href="https://www.christosmakridis.com/">Christos Makridis</a></u> at <u><a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford Univeristy</a></u> where the research was focused on areas of public and labor economics .

Cheers!
